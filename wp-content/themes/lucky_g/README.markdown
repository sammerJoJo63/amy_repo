A Brief Introduction
====================
Reverie Framework is an extremely versatile HTML5 WordPress framework based on ZURB's [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), a powerful tool for building prototypes on any kind of devices. Reverie follows [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) standard and is [hNews microformat](https://www.readability.com/publishers/guidelines) ready. It is optimized for Search Engine while at the same time improves readability.

It is extremely easy to create your blog, CMS, brochure and any other kind of sites with Reverie. You can see some [samples](http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.php) on ZURB and how they make these prototypes. Did I just mention Reverie works well with [bbPress 2.0](http://bbpress.org/) and [BuddyPress 1.5](http://buddypress.org/)?

What are the Features?

Positive. With the power of Foundation, Reverie uses media query to adjust for all kinds of devices, including phones, tablets and computers. Reverie is also optimized for iPhone and iPad.

TheAkiba (Previously on ThemeFortress)
=============
Reverie is a WordPress framework created by [TheAkiba](http://theakiba.com), my personal blog focus Japanese Anime and Games, instead of WordPress theme design. The old ThemeFortress website was no longer maintained and Reverie was now on TheAkiba, my other personal site.
